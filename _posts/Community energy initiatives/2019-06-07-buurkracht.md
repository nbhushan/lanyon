To mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming, households across the world need to reduce their fossil energy consumption. To this end, environmental community energy initiatives, characterised by bottom-up local initiatives; predominantly driven by volunteers have been emerging across many towns in the Netherlands and beyond. Such initiatives  are collective approaches where individuals (or households) form or join a local initiative to pursue a common goal.

Buurkracht is a prominent example of a a community energy initiative in the Netherlands. With Buurkracht, the energy service company Enexis hopes to stimulate local communities to self-organize into energy-saving clusters. In particular, Buurkracht targets energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy resources. The objectives of my research are:
1) Gain insight into factors which predict membership in Buurkracht.
2) Explore how membership in Buurkracht may affect other energy saving behaviours (spillover effects).
