### Case description

Efficient energy management is one of the most critical aspects of any office space. Devices such as printers are a heavy electrical load and require large amounts of power. Incorporating efficient and intelligent energy management in these devices can result in sustainable office spaces.

Ideally every device in an office should have energy sensing capabilities through which it can continuously monitor and optimize energy consumption. But since this is not always the case, current approaches involve non intrusive load monitoring or individually estimating the energy consumption of each device using predictive models and then optimizing the parameters which affect power consumption. A key issue with these approaches is that the predictive model may not be accurate.

The question I focus on is **How do we build an accurate energy model of how electrical devices consume energy**.

### Case analysis
There was no data present. My first task was to define the data required to model the process, and further, design hardware that could be capable of remotely sensing and storing the data.

I used a phidget (i-snail-VC-10) sensor to record active power consumption of the devices. Phidgets are a viable alternative to traditional sensors and transducers. They are low cost and can be easily controlled by USB from a host computer. Physical widgets or phidgets are to physical user interfaces what widgets are to graphical user interfaces. Furthermore, I connected the sensor to the Phidget Interface kit (PIK). The PIK is then connected to the computer using USB. I developed an application in C# to control the sensor and store the power data recorded in a database (SQL).

To model the recorded data, I used a Hidden Markov model based clustering approach to build an accurate energy model of how electrical devices consume energy. As described by the client, I created an easy-to-use application in C# to retrieve, model, and visalize the energy model of the device.
