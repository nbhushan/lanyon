## Case description
In so-called problem-oriented fields such as environmental psychology, researchers often study how variables from different theories can help to explain a phenomenon to help solve a problem.

Furthermore, applied psychologists may often work on large projects in which people from different (sub) disciplines collaborate in understanding climate-change related topics (or other complex challenges). Such problem-oriented approaches often aim to examine multiple research questions and test multiple hypotheses and theories, typically with questionnaire studies. This can result in large multivariate datasets. In such situations, researchers would profit from tools that help them get a 'feel' for patterns in their dataset in an intuitive manner.

Typically, exploratory analyses involve computing bivariate correlations between items and variables and presenting them in a table. While this is suitable for relatively small data sets, such tables can easily become overwhelming when datasets contain a broad set of variables from multiple theories.

The key problem posed to me was: **Research and develop innovative tools to explore relationships in large datasets with several variables**

## Case analysis
Discussion with environmental psychologists revealed that in their field, exploratory analyses may involve three steps. First, relationships between items included in a study can be explored to get some initial insights into whether items that are assumed to measure the same underlying construct are indeed correlated. Second, after aggregating individual items into relevant scales, they can explore relationships between variables, as they would expect on the basis of theory. Third, in cases where the dataset comprises of multiple groups, such analyses are helpful to examine similarities and differences in relationships between these variables across groups.

I proposed the Gaussian graphical model as a novel exploratory
analysis tool for applied researchers that provides an easy to grasp overview of relationships between items and variables included in a study.

The results suggest that Gaussian graphical models can be particularly useful when researchers include variables from theories not studied together in combination before. In addition, these models can also be useful when experts from multiple (sub) disciplines collaborate in understanding climate-change related topics or other complex problems. Furthermore, this method not only provides some initial insights into relationships between items and variables, but can also lead to new theorising, which can then be tested on a new dataset.
