Welcome to my page. Glad to have you as a visitor.
------------------
I am a phd candidate at the University of Groningen working with Casper Albers & Linda Steg on modeling the energy transition from a psychological perspective. <br>
My research interests are machine learning and statistics, energy transition, and data visualization.
Currently, I am applying machine learning techniques to explore and understand how households consume energy in the era of decentralised enery systems.

I obtained my masterâ€™s degree (MSc) in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Maastricht during which

I spent a summer at Xerox Research Center Europe working on a smart energy management systems with Yves Hoppenot & Jean-marc Andreoli.<br>
<br>My undergraduate degree is in electrical engineering with an emphasis on distributed energy systems.

In my free time, I enjoy rock-climbing and bouldering in particular.
In my perspective, the aim of climbing is not just getting to the top, but to appreciate the quality of the movement that takes us there.

Apart from climbing, I enjoy cooking **not--too-spicy** indian food and mediterranean recipies.
I am not fussy about music or movies, but I do strongly support independent radios such as Radio Paradise.
