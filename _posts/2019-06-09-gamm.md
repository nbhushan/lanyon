## Case description
To mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming, households across the world need to reduce their fossil energy consumption. To this end, environmental community energy initiatives, characterized by bottom-up local initiatives; predominantly driven by volunteers have been emerging across many towns in the Netherlands and beyond. Such initiatives  are collective approaches where individuals (or households) form or join a local initiative to pursue a common goal.

Buurkracht is a prominent example of a a community energy initiative in the Netherlands. The goal of Buurkracht is to stimulate local communities to self-organize into energy-saving clusters. In particular, Buurkracht targets energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy resources.

While not a key targer of Buurkracht, reducing peak demand is a key aspect of climate change mitigation in the residential sector. This is because peak demand is often supplied with energy from fossil-powered sources such as natural gas and petroleum. High frequency smart meter data enable us to study how being a member of a pro-environmental initiative can influence the day-to-day dynamics of energy consumption such as peak demand behaviors.

Hence, the key question which I focus on is:
**Does membership in Buurkracht affect other energy saving behaviors, in particular peak demand consumption?**

## Case analysis
Every Buurkracht member is provided with a smart meter. These meters measure electricity and gas consumption every 15min. The typical data from a smart meter can be visualized as a time-series.

We can clearly see that energy consumption follows a seasonal pattern. There are time-of-day effects and weather effects which drive the dynamics of energy consumption. A typical daily consumption profile of a Buurkracht neighborhood in Groningen is shown below.

Recall that one of the key goals of Buurkracht is to encourage adoption of renewable energy sources such as PV-panels (zonnepanelen). In the above figure, the blue line in the above figure represents the daily consumption profiles Buurkracht members who invested in a PV panel; and the red line represents the daily profile of Buurkracht members who chose not to invest in a PV panel. We can now investigate difference in these two classes of Buurkracht members using a statistical model.

As the figure indicates, one would expect differences in daily energy consumption when the sun is shining (indicated by the portion highlighted in red).

*However, if the red portion also includes the evening peak, it indicates that investing in a PV-panel also affect how households consume energy during peak demand hours.*

I answered this case question using a non-linear general additive mixed model. The final model includes  smart meter data from **4865 households** and is run on a high performance computer cluster I'm currently analyzing the results

This is an interactive dashboard built using R-shiny which enables users to **load/explore/model/understand** energy consumption of Buurkracht members.
