Welcome to my page, glad to have you as a visitor!

I grew up in Bangalore, India. After 21 years of taking the sun for granted, I moved to Maastricht, Netherlands. I initially found it hard to adjust to life abroad. Fate intervened and I was offered a chance to move to Grenoble, France. After a year in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, I moved back to India. However, I missed the European way of life and soon found myself in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Now I live in Groningen and it's a close second for the most beautiful place on Earth! <br> *Er gaat niets boven Groningen*

## Education
My undergraduate studies in electrical engineering and power systems (MSRIT, India) gives me a strong foundation in the electricity systems and power grids. To further learn about how to model a future grid which will almost certainly involve an element of randomness (e.g., due to intermittent renewable generation), I pursued a MSc in artificial intelligence (Maastricht University, Netherlands) and specialized in machine learning and statistical modelling and applied these methods to develop smart energy management systems.

After years of wearing a technical hat, I chose to switch and try on the hat of a data scientist, but staying loyal to my roots in the energy transition. I was fortunate to be offered a PhD position in statistics in which I developed models to explore the human dimension of the energy transition under the supervision of Casper Albers & Linda Steg.

During my PhD, I closely collaborated with the industry. In particular, I developed solutions to questions posed by Buurkracht, a community-driven intervention aimed to promote energy efficiency amongst its partakers.

The experience I gained working and studying with multiple disciplines has taught me more than I would have ever gained following a traditional path.

See my [projects]({% link categories.html %}) for examples of me applying the skills I gained to solve problems of practical interest.

## Things I find fun
In my free time, I enjoy rock-climbing and bouldering in particular.
In my perspective, the aim of climbing is not just getting to the top, but to appreciate the quality of the movement that takes us there.

Apart from climbing, I enjoy cooking **not--too-spicy** indian food and mediterranean recipes.

I am not fussy about music or movies, but I do strongly support independent radios such as Radio Paradise. <img src="{{ site.github.repo }}/assets/rp.png" alt="rpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
